    <h2>ATTRIBUTES</h2>
    <P>Most of the attributes of an element are name value pairs, separated by = and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML). Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element, like the ismap attribute for the img element.</P>
    <p>There are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :</p>

        <p>The "id" attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page.</p>
        <p>The "class" attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation <class="notation"> to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in microformats</p> <p>Multiple class values may be specified; for example <class="notation important"> puts the element into both the notation and the important classes.</p>
        <p>An author may use the "style" attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's id or class attributes to select the element from within a stylesheet, though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.</p>
        <p>The "title" attribute is used to attach a subtextual explanation to an element. In most browsers this attribute is displayed as a tooltip.
        The "lang" attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document:</p>
        <!--For Example:::: <p>Oh well, <span lang="fr">c'est la vie</span>, as they say in France.</p> -->
