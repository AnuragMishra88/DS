    <h1>ELEMENTS</h1>
    <p>
        HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets thus: <!--<p>-->

            <p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" <!--<p>--> and "end tag" <!--</p>-->. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>
            
            <p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>
        
            
            <p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <!--<img>--> used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: <!--<img src="example.com/example.jpg">--></p>
            
            <p>Some elements, such as the line break <!--<br>--> do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>
            
            <p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element , are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.</p>
            
            <p>The general form of an HTML element is therefore: <!--<tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">''content''</tag>-->. . Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the break tag or the inline image tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case</p>
    </p>
    <h3>HEADINGS
    </h3>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least:</p>
    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
<h3>Line Breaks</h3>
<p>The difference between br and p is that br breaks a line without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas p sections the page into paragraphs. The element br is an empty element in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it may not have an end tag.</p>
<h3>LINKS</h3>
<p>
    This is a link in HTML. To create a link the anchor tag is used. The href attribute holds the URL address of the link.
</p>
<p><a href=" ">HI</a></p>
<H3>INPUTS</H3>
<p>There are many possible ways a user can give input/s like:
    <!-- <input type="text"> This is for text input -->
<!-- <input type="file"> This is for uploading files -->
<!-- <input type="checkbox"> This is for checkboxes -->
 <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
 <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    
    Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
    
    The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
    
    The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</p>
</p>
<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
<p>An inline element does not start on a new line.

    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    
    This is a span element inside a paragraph.</p>
